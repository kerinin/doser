# doser
Aquarium Doser

## ATO

Reads from some number of water level sensors, periodically fills until a sensor is triggered. 
Configurable fill rate (mL/s), frequency (cron), and max fill amount.
Should alert if the sensor doesn't trigger after some amount of time (pump failure) or if backup sensors trigger (sensor failure).
There may be an opportunity to use a variation on PID control logic.


## AWC

Paired set of pumps that always run at the same rate.
Configurable exchange rate (L/day)
One pump adds fresh water, one removes old water.


## Doser

Set of pumps that always run at different times.
Configurable dose rate for each pump (mL/day)
Each pump adds a specific additive.
Eventually the dosing rate could be driven by an automated tester.
